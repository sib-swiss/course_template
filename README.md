# Course template

This is a template for SIB-training course repository when there is no website attached that you can use to [create a new repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)

> If you want to have a repository with a website attached go to the [course_website_template](https://github.com/sib-swiss/course_website_template) instead.

This templates offers a number of basic elements that should be common to all course repository, 
like a readme, a file describing the license, or giving zenodo information when publishing a release.

 * README.md    : this file. It will be presented on the front page of your repository.
 * .zenodo.json : JSON file to preset the data when publishing a release with zenodo. Change the course title and content creator part.
 * LICENSE.md   : CC-BY-4.0 license ; this file is used by github to show this on your repository



We also propose three folders to organize course content.

 * slides/ : put there the pdf file of your slides
 * data/   : put there data files used in demonstrations, exercises, and hands-on
 * assets/ : put there "resource" files such as the pptx files of your slides, some images files, pdfs which are not directly part of the slides (such as a manual, a cheatsheet, ...), ...
